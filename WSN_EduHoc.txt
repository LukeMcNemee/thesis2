# Edu-hoc project

  * educational platform / framework

  * ad-hoc networks, mostly WSN

  * focus on ease of use

## Provides:

  * study text, examples, video

  * exercises, solutions, evaluation

-----

# Motivation - WSN reality

## limited in

  * computational power

  * memory

  * battery power

  * price

  * ...

-----

# Motivation II. - WSN reality

  * hop by hop communication

  * specialized OS (performance oriented)

  * C dialect (NesC)

## usual tasks are not trivial

  * routing

  * intruder detection

  * key exchange

  * ...

-----

# Edu-hoc solution

  * Arduino based network

  * simple C code

  * set of exercises (scenarios)

  * Solve scenarios as attacker

  * Fix code to prevent such attacks

-----

# Exercises

  * currently 5 scenarios

  * Each with different objective

### evaluation as percentage of messages

  - captured

  - delivered

  - modified

-----

# Exercises

## 1. Eavesdropping

 * unsecured network

 * global broadcast from each node

 * unique identification of each message

 * capture as many messages as possible

-----

# Exercises

## 2. Black hole - routing attack

 * network with dynamic routing

 * initial phase of route establishment

 * prevent as many packets from reaching BS

-----

# Exercises

## 3. Sinkhole - routing attack

 * network with dynamic routing

 * initial phase of route establishment

 * deliver as many modified messages as possible

 * capture, modify and send back

 * each attacker with unique string to modify messages with

# Exercises

## 4. Jamming

 * secured network

 * fixed routing

 * prevent as many packets from reaching BS

 * No way to modify routes etc.

 * solution -> Jamming

-----

# Exercises

## 5. Relay attack

 * neighbor discovery

 * make two nodes neighbors even when they are not.

 * evaluation not yet determined

-----

# Infrastructure behind

 * automatic deployment for the whole network

 * mass configuration, communication with nodes

 * scheduled runs of individual scenarios

 * web server with evaluation and current network state
