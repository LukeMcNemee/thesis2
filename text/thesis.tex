    \subsection{Quantization principle (bits from signal strength)}
    Quantization enables to extract bits from individual values of signal strength. There are many different approaches to this problem %\CITE
    two main approaches here are: lossless quantization CITE and contrary to that we have lossy quantization.

    Main difference between these is number of generated bits per original signal strength measurements, while lossless quantization produces bit value from every measurement of signal strength, which is usefull for high performance demands, but it requires guaranteed varinace in the radio channel (e.g. the nodes are constantly moving, or the nevironment is changing) during the key establishment phase. CITE Otherwise the resulting keys could possibly be wery weak. CITE

    Lossy quantization on the other hand does not have guaranteed output lenght per number of measured values, which can lead to very limited length of output. However this kind of quantization is expected to have better results in static enviroments %CITE if possible
    because its nature is to drop such bits, that fail to differ from others.

    Since our network is static and without any moving nodes, we implemented lossy quantizer algorithm designed by Mathur et.al.%/TODO verify name
    , which shoved promissing results for of the shelf wireless devices simmilar to ours, and also contained experimental results from several different scenarios, where some of these were comparable to our conditions.

\chapter{Education use}

  \section{motivation for educational WSN network}
  The current state of the art WSN devices usually uses specialized hardware
  and software in order to achieve the best performance available. This,
  unfortunately, is not the ideal prerequisite for an easy to learn matter.
  In fact, most of WSN devices have rather complicated setup and are
  quite challenging for novices.

  Because of such discouragement, it is difficult to teach how to
  work with WSN’s; few hours (at least) are usually required
  to explain the basics, which is reasonable for research project or
  something similar, but for class exercise, this would turn out to be
  not the most effective use of time, if it would be achievable at all. And
  we have not yet mentioned more advanced topics in this area, such as
  common encryption or message authentication techniques.

  Issue of this nature can be solved in various ways, %\CITE
  in case of Edu-hoc we decided to sacrifice performance \ref{sec:hw}; which is not that much important for network with educational purpose. On the other hand,
